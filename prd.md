# Typist PRD

Source of truth for scope, architecture, and delivery status.

## Product

Typist is a markdown product with two apps:

- `apps/desktop`: Electron app for local markdown viewing and editing
- `apps/web`: landing/download site for distribution

Principles:

- simplicity over feature sprawl
- beauty over complexity
- speed over configurability
- local-first by default

## Goals

- best-in-class markdown rendering
- fast markdown editing with a path to inline WYSIWYG
- open files and folders directly
- excellent reading experience
- workspace search
- themes
- drag-and-drop media support

Non-goals for v1:

- cloud sync
- plugins
- collaboration
- graph view
- database-heavy note management

- Electron
- React
- Vite
- TypeScript
- Zustand
- `chokidar`
- TipTap

Web:
